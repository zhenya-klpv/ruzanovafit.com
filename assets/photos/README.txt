Photos used on the site

Drop the provided photos into this folder to enable the hero/about visuals.

Expected filenames:
- Hero background (stage photo): hero-stage.jpg
- About photo (medal/closeup): about-medal.jpg

Optional (recommended for performance):
- Provide WebP versions with the same names:
  - hero-stage.webp
  - about-medal.webp

Premium portrait (About):
- about-cutout.webp (WebP with alpha, transparent background)
  - The site renders it as a "premium portrait" with softer edges (CSS softening + shadow).
